            <p>Your mental is like a muscle; you must strain this muscle through
            doing rigorous activies in order to grow and callus the muscle. To do
            so, start by doing something immediately challenging in the morning.
            The brain wants to do absolutely nothing in the morning. The brain
            wants to go back to sleep. This is a perfect opportunity to make it
            suffer. I hate running so the first thing I do in the morning is run
            at least 2 miles. This wakes up my brain and forces it to focus as
            the outside is still dark and I am terribly near-sighted. If the toughest
            part of the day is conquered early, the rest of the day pales in comparison.
            </p>

            <p>You must also consider a state of mind popularized by David Goggins:
            the Dog Mentality; literally equate yourself to a dog. A dog will continue
            its goal until it can no longer physically continue.
            A pitbull will bite down onto something so hard it will lock its jaws.
            Hachi the Akita Inu waited for his dead master until he too died.
            My dog ate grass until she threw up and continued to eat grass. The
            moral of these stories is that you must continue to claw your way
            towards your goals until you can not no longer physically continue.
            Every single day.</p>

              Your body must be as sharp as your brain. A 140 IQ is useless in
            a body that will die by the age of 40. You must train your body to
            to be able to do anything; Able to fight, able to lift, able to
            run, and able to sustain pain. But most importantly, your body must
            be able to sustain a life of aging and working. If all your body does
            is sit down and type on a keyboard, this is all your body knows. Your
            mind can be infinitely powerful but will be worth nothing if the
            vessel that holds it is a fat, high insulin body. Note this extensively.

                The only liquid you should be drinking is water (protein shake may
              be an exception). Other drinks either have too much processed sugar
              or too much calories or even worse, both. Though black coffee has
              its benefits, I see anything with caffeine as a cheat for energy. If
              I need energy, I choose to run off pure adrenaline. Water has overwhelming
              benefits and little to no negatives. Water clears the body of liquid waste,
              clears the skin, eliminates bloating and water weight, and hydrates the body.
              Drink water until your urine is clear.

            <p>
                Intermittent fasting is great for two things: energy and fat loss.
              When working out, especially doing cardio, on a fast the body is given
              a tremendous amount of energy. I do not know whether it's the body
              going back into a primitive state of starving and hunting or some other
              semi-believable reason but doing a run, boxing, or lifting weights seems
              to be more explosive and feel better when on a fast. In contrast, if I
              eat a meal before working out, I feel bloated and lethargic due to by
              body still digesting food. As for fat loss (unless overcompensating during
              meal time), the body will go into a caloric deficit in a fast meaning fat
              loss is bound to happen. There are much more benefits to intermittent
              fasting but these are the benefits I found useful in my life.

              Everyone should know how to fight. Fighting should be a necessity.
            Simply learning how to throw a punch and how to know when someone is
            going to throw a punch is crucial. But from less of a violence perspective,
            fighting is great for physical fitness. Fighting trains the whole body
            and develops different parts of the body; there is a major difference
            between being in shape and being in fighting shape. For me personally,
            fighting requires both the mind and body to be highly active
            simultaneously and so unlike other workouts, keeps me stimulated. Just
            knowing you can practically beat up 90% of people is supreme confidence.

            <p>
              Like mentioned before, I hate running and hate brainless cardio
            in general. Though forcing yourself to do things that hard but benefitial
            to you physically, benefits you mentally. Cardio raises the heart rate
            and requires lots of oxygen which makes your body perform aerobic respiration.
            Aerobic exercise in general uses fat for fuel making the body lean. Cardio is
            great for endurance in physical activities such as boxing and playing basketball.
            Cardio, though most times mundane, has so much use for the body and its ability
            to perform.

            <p>Finally, resistance training whether with weights or calisthenics,
            is the holy grail for strength and conditioning. The body must have the
            strength to hit hard, explode off of either leg, and lift and throw heavy
            objects. Strength and conditioning elevates every other physical activity
            as your body can withstand more rigorous training.
            And at the end of the day, resistance training grows muscles
            and just makes the body look good. A confidence in your body is almost
            unmatched. When you look good, you feel good, and when you feel good
            you perform everything else at a higher level. I would be damned if I put my
            body through hell and didn't look good doing it.</p>

              <p>
                My daily routine is nothing special. I essentially wake up, workout,
                and work. However, I hope to continue to my good habit of doing
                something painfully hard in the morning. Like mentioned before,
                conquering something hard first thing in the morning sets the tone
                for the rest of the day. Just knowing that I chose to get out of
                bed and run rather than lay in bed is such a mental boost.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the rest of the day, my primary goal is to get shit done.
                Though the schedule looks repetitive, the work I do ranges from
                coding, going to classes, or other chores giving me a variety
                goals to accomplish throughout the day. My goal for each and every
                day is to be able to destroy the version of myself yesterday. I want
                to be smarter than who I was yesterday. I want to be able to be stronger
                and faster than who I was yesterday. I want to be able to fight and kill
                the person I was yesterday. Progression is my motivation.
              </p>
              <p>As for the reading and meditation, I believe it is good for the
                mind to be absolutely clear before going to bed. Using your phone
                or computer before sleeping emitts a ton of blue light is bad for
                sleep quality and benefits of good sleep are endless. So clearing
                the mind and disconnecting it from the outside world before going
                to bed is paramount.

              I made the website for two things: a website to showcase sweet
              web development animations and to hold myself accountable. These are
              the values I want to follow and if these values are put on the Internet, it
              would be dishonorable to not abide by them. If I talk all this talk about
              being productive and motivated, then in turn I must walk the walk as well.
              Currently, I am nobody. I am no where near the goals I have set but I hope
              with these core values, I can get somewhere.
